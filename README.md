# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer



---

## Description

The **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize the working of various sorting algorithms. The array elements are shown as vertical bars, and each bar’s height represents the value. The user can see how the sorting algorithms operate in real-time and understand their efficiency.

### Features:
- **Interactive UI**: Click on a sorting algorithm to visualize its process.
- **Color Coding**: The different phases of the sorting algorithm are visually distinguished by colors:
  - **Red** - Swap operation
  - **Blue** - Comparison operation
  - **Green** - Element is in its sorted position


### Sorting Algorithms Implemented:
- **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they're in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the sorted portion.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- **Quick Sort**: Selects a pivot element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

By running these algorithms on an array of random values, this visualizer compares their performance and allows for an understanding of the underlying logic and time complexity involved in the sorting process.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the basic structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the UI visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic for the sorting algorithms and the interactivity (using p5.js for visual rendering).

## How to Use

1. Visit the live demo or clone the repository.
2. Select any sorting algorithm from the list.
3. Click the "Start" button to visualize the sorting process.
4. Watch the algorithm sort the elements in real-time and observe the swap and comparison steps.
